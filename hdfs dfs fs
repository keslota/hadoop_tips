Following are the three commands which appears same but have minute differences

hadoop fs {args}
hadoop dfs {args}
hdfs dfs {args}

  hadoop fs <args>
FS relates to a generic file system which can point to any file systems like local, HDFS etc. So this can be used when you are dealing with different file systems such as Local FS, (S)FTP, S3, and others

  hadoop dfs <args>
dfs is very specific to HDFS. would work for operation relates to HDFS. This has been deprecated and we should use hdfs dfs instead.

  hdfs dfs <args>
same as 2nd i.e would work for all the operations related to HDFS and is the recommended command instead of hadoop dfs

below is the list categorized as hdfs commands.

  namenode|secondarynamenode|datanode|dfs|dfsadmin|fsck|balancer|fetchdt|oiv|dfsgroups
So even if you use hadoop dfs, it will look locate hdfs and delegate that command to hdfs dfs

Best way to Export Hive table to CSV file

Method 1 :
hive -e 'select * from table_orc_data;' | sed 's/[[:space:]]\+/,/g' > ~/output.csv
Pros : Simple to use, output column header but default output is tab.
Cons : Need to convert Tab delimiter to ‘,’ which could be time consuming when exporting large file.

Method 2:
$ hadoop fs -cat hdfs://servername/user/hive/warehouse/databasename/table_csv_export_data/* > ~/output.csvCopy
Pros : Simple, with comma as delimiter in CSV output.
Cons : No column headers.

Method 3: (My personal favorite)
— Step 3a: Create CSV table with dummy header column as first row.
CREATE TABLE table_csv_export_data
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED as textfile
AS
select
names column;

— Step 3b: Now insert data actual data into table
INSERT INTO table_csv_export_data
SELECT
 id
 ,first_name
 ,last_name
 ,join_date
FROM
 table_orc_data;
 
— Step 3c
hadoop fs -cat hdfs://servername/user/hive/warehouse/databasename/table_csv_export_data/* > ~/output.csv


hdfs dfs -getfacl [-R] <path>
Displays the Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and directories. If a directory has a default ACL, then getfacl also displays the default ACL.

hdfs dfs -setfacl [-R] [-b |-k -m |-x <acl_spec> <path>] |[--set <acl_spec> <path>]
Sets Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and directories.
